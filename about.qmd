This website is made by Mihir Kaushal on June 21st, 2024. 

I created this website as part of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp. I made the website using the R language. I utilized the help of ChatGPT to fix any errors I ran into. 

I got inspired to do this project related to crimes in Chicago because I live in Chicago suburbs. I wanted to explore how crimes have changed over the years, especially with COVID slowing things down. Overall, I had a lot of fun making this project and I learned a lot through making the graphs and analyzing the data.
