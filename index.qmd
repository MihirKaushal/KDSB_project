<!-- Intro paragraph  -->

Chicago has been known as one of the most dangerous cities in America. Many people believe that crimes have only been getting worse over the years. The data is from [data.cityofchicago.org](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) and they update the data every day. I used this data to make graphs to see how crimes in Chicago have changed over the years and if COVID had an impact on crime rates. The data originally had over 8 million rows, so I had to filter some of them out and only keep the information that I wanted to analyze. By analyzing the graphs, I saw several relationships that were unexpected.

```{r}
# This graph shows the number of motor thefts in Chicago on the y axis, and the year (2001 - 2024) on the x axis,the color represents if there has been an arrest made or not.
#| label: motor_theft_graph 

motor_theft_data <- read_csv("motor_theft_chicago_2001-now.csv")  # Read the motor theft data from a CSV file

# Create a bar plot using ggplot2
p <- ggplot(motor_theft_data, aes(x = Year, fill = Arrest)) +  # Define the aesthetics, mapping Year to x-axis and Arrest status to fill color
     geom_bar(alpha = 0.7, color = "black", width = 1, stat = "count") +  # Add a bar plot layer with semi-transparent bars and black borders
     scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # Format y-axis labels with commas
     scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2001:2024)) +  # Set x-axis breaks from 2001 to 2024
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotate x-axis text for better readability
     labs(title = "Auto Theft in Chicago from 2001 to Present",  # Add plot title
          subtitle = "Most cases did not lead to arrests and the overall number of cases \n were decreasing but increase again in 2022.",  # Add plot subtitle
          x = "Year",  # Add x-axis label
          y = "Number of Cases",  # Add y-axis label
          caption = "Source: data.cityofchicago.org") +  # Add data source caption
     theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 36, color = "white"),  # Customize plot title text
           plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 28, color = "white"),  # Customize plot subtitle text
           axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24, color = "white"),  # Customize x-axis title text
           axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24, color = "white"),  # Customize y-axis title text
           axis.text.x = element_text(size = 16, color = "white"),  # Customize x-axis text
           axis.text.y = element_text(size = 16, color = "white"),  # Customize y-axis text
           plot.caption = element_text(size = 24, color = "white"),  # Customize caption text
           legend.text = element_text(size = 24, color = "white"),  # Customize legend text
           legend.title = element_text(size = 24, color = "white"),  # Customize legend title text
           legend.key.size = unit(2, "cm"),  # Set legend key size
           legend.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),  # Set legend background color
           plot.margin = margin(2, 2, 2, 2, "cm"),  # Set plot margins
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),  # Set panel background color
           plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black", colour = "darkgray"))  # Set plot background color and border

ggsave("motor_theft_graph.png", plot = p, width = 18, height = 12, units = "in", limitsize = FALSE)  # Save the plot as a PNG file

knitr::include_graphics("motor_theft_graph.png")  # Include the saved plot in the document

```

We can see that the motor theft in Chicago in 2022 is more than twice the amount in 2021 and the motor theft cases in 2023 were the highest they have every been in 20 years. It is unexpected how few people were arrested because of motor theft.

```

From this graph, we can see that the narcotics related crimes had been going down.

```

This graph shows that theft is the biggest type of crime committed in Chicago. The number of crimes committed decreased by a small amount, this might have been because of COVID.
